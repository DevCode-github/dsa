It is a linear data structure that follows a specific order in which operations are performed.
The order may be **LIFO**(last in first out) or **FILO**(first in last out)

### Operations on stack
1. Push
2. Pop
3. Peek
4. Size
5. isEmpty

### Applications
1. Function calls & recursion
2. Expression evaluation
3. Undo & redo functionality
4. Parsing and Syntax analysis

### Advantage
1. **Simplicity**: Simple and easy to understand, 'making them suitable for' wide range of application.
2. **Efficiency** : Operations are done constant time O(1)
3. **Limited Memory Usage**: Only store elements that has pushed on onto the stack.
### Disadvantage
1. **Potential for Overflow**: If more elements are pushed on than it can handle.
2. **No Random Access**: Can only access the top element.

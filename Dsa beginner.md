## Data Structure
---
It is a way of storing and organizing data on a device to use is effectively and efficiently.
Data Structure are divided into two types:
1. **Primitive DS** - They are primitive data types like int, char, long, float etc. They can only contain single value.
2. **Non-Primitive** DS: Further divided into two types -
	1. Linear DS - Arrangement of data in sequential manner
	2. Non-linear DS - Data is not arranged in sequential manner and there exist a hierarchical relationship between individual data item 

### Data structures
- Linear DS
	1. [[Array]]
	2. String
	3.  [[Linked List]]
	5. [[Stack]]
	6. [[Queue]]
- Non-linear DS
	  1. Tree
		  1. Heap / Completed Binary Tree
	  2. Graph


## Algorithm
It is a process or set of well defined instructions that is used to solve a problem or perform a specific calculation.
